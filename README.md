### About the hardware

These circuit snippets connect 3.3V MB85RS FRAM chips to 5V Arduino inputs / outputs.  

Two design approaches are shown:

1. Discrete design using BSS108 FETs, following the approach used by the Adafruit level converter.

2. Integrated design using TXB0104 to reduce PCB space required. 

**Note: These circuits have not yet been verified in hardware.**
